# SPOTSTITCH/GRAVITY

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: March 14th 2021
 * Where: Zoom group call

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * Decision One: Organizing tasks for the group on Trello and assigning them to individuals. This was very helpful as it both allowed for us to keep track of individuals progress on their respective tasks and gave the team an overview of how the project was progressing holistically. 
 * Decision Two: Using Zoom meetings to give updates on each members progress and also to keep the team focused on the bigger picture (i.e. relating back to Spotstitch's wants/needs). This was a good idea as while the Trello board provided this information, it was helpful to speak "in person" to address any concerns or difficulties people were having with getting things set up or to troubleshoot any bugs they encountered.
 * Decision Three : Establishing one person to communicate with the Spotstitch team to give regular email updates, reply on slack and schedule meetings. This was a good idea as it allowed for the Spotstitch members to have a primary contact and prevented any mix-ups in conflicting emails/information.
 * Decision Four: Maintaining open communication on Facebook messenger with all teammates. This was helpful as it let us set up impromptu meetings to debug/help set up people's environments as issues came up, whoever was available to help at the time could meet with a person who needed help.

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * Decision One: Not having regular meetings between the frontend and backend teams. For the most part the front end team did not meet with the backend team unless at larger team meetings which were primarily dedicated to addressing whether we were on target with Spotstitch's requirements and thinking about how to communicate our progress with them and seek clarification on certain items. While the team meetings as a whole were successful, the nature of them prevented the frontend team from having a thorough understanding of what the goals of the backend team were and vice versa. While we were discussing big picture items at team meetings, and having regular meetings to debug/setup/code together within frontend and backend teams, the two teams did not go over their code in any meetings together and this ended up causing a few miscommunications. 
 * Decision Two: Not having regular meetings with the Spotstitch team. Unfortunately we hoped to schedule a regular time but due to differing timezones and a busy work schedule that some of the Spotstitch team had, this was not feasible. The drawback of having to schedule each meeting we wanted to have was that they were regularly pushed back and did not happen as often as we'd like. We'd have to ask for dates and times every week, and oftentimes they wouldn't pan out. However, we were able to get some communication over slack and email.

#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Decision One: Scheduling regular update meetings between frontend and backend teams to get up to date and read each other's code. This way the needs of each frontned/backend team are not just communicated via assigned Trello tasks but carefully thought over and understood by each party. This will prevent miscommunications in the future.
 * Decision Two: Scheduling future meetings with the Spotstitch team such that by the end of each meeting there is always a future meeting time agreed upon and scheduled in (even if they are not regularly occuring on a certain date, there needs to be a future one established by the end of each meeting). 


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 
How did you prepare your demo?

> We recorded a demo showcasing front-end functionalities. Additionally, we composed an explanation regarding developments in the back-end, such as database design (tables & their relationships) and GraphQL schema, KeyCloak authentication, and the coupling between the back-end and front-end. 

What did you manage to demo to your partner?

> Due to schedulding and East-West coast time-zone difficulties, a demo could not be set up before the due date. We sent the materials described in the above question and we are still waiting on feedback.

Did your partner accept the features?

> See above.

Were there change requests?

> See above.

What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?

> We learned the importance of regularly scheduled meeting with our partner, Human City. 

> Furthermore, we realized just how important it is to have a stable version of the application come time to demo. The team was forced into a time crunch in order to have a functional, asthetically pleasing demo.

> For example, we'd scheduled to develop a broad range of features for this deliverable. This resulted in an influx of unconnected pages nearing the end of the developmental cycle. In hindsight, it would have been more appropriate to create less content overall, but a more robust and connected application.

> There was also a pesky error regarding a non-existent font which created an on-screen pop-up. Obviously, this couldn't be seen during the demo, so someone spent far too long pin-pointing the error to change a single line.

> In short, we learned that, in preparation for a deadline such as a demo, a plan should be created such that relevant features are completed well beforehand, since unforseen issues can (and will) arise.
